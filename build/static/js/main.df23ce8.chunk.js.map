Apa itu Season?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Season adalah sistem pembagian musim turnamen di MABAR yang mengikuti\r\nkalender akademis sekolah, yaitu dimulai di Agustus dan berakhir di Juli.\r\n\r\n> Dalam satu season, turnamen utama MABAR diadakan sebanyak dua kali (split).\r\nYaitu: Fall split (Agustus-Januari) dan Spring split (Februari-Juli). Artinya, setiap\r\nseason, tiap orang berkesempatan mengikuti turnamen dua kali.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Game & Match\r\n\r\n### 1. Bagaimana jika tim sudah check in untuk bertanding, namun lawan tidak hadir di in-game?\r\n\r\n> Pertandingan akan dianggap tidak valid jika tidak ada hasil pertandingan yang\r\ndisubmit. MABAR menjunjung tinggi komitmen dalam setiap pertandingan dan\r\nberharap seluruh tim peserta dapat memberi respek kepada lawannya dengan\r\nmenjalankan pertandingan sesuai jadwal.\r\n\r\n> Dalam situasi tim lawan tidak hadir, tim yang hadir dapat melaporkan lawannya\r\ndan akan menang WO. Tim yang kalah WO akan ditindaklanjuti oleh MABAR\r\nsesuai peraturan yang berlaku pada masa tersebut.\r\n\r\n> Peserta dapat mengemail kami di <hi@mabar.com>.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Bagaimana cara mengubah game nickname?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Nickname tidak dapat diubah. Perhatikan pilihan nickname sejak awal membuat\r\n>akun. Apabila terpaksa harus mengganti nickname, silakan email kami di\r\n><hi@mabar.com>.\r\n\r\n### 3. Kenapa peserta harus melakukan screenshot atas pertandingan dan mengupload ke\r\n\r\n### platform?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Screenshot pertandingan dan menguploadnya ke platform adalah wajib.\r\n>Screenshot menjadi bukti pertandingan sudah berlangsung dan menjadi dasar\r\n>catatan kemenangan/kekalahan peserta. MABAR juga mengambil catatan\r\n>statistik dari screenshot ini, untuk dapat menjadi data penting pengguna.\r\n\r\n### 4. Seberapa lama batas waktu yang diberikan untuk mengupload screenshot? Dan apa\r\n\r\n### yang terjadi kalau peserta tidak mengupload screenshot?\r\n\r\n\r\n> Peserta harus mengupload screenshot selambat-lambatnya 2 jam setelah jadwal\r\n>tanding selesai. Tanpa adanya screenshot, pertandingan belum dianggap\r\n>selesai.\r\n\r\n### 5. Apa yang harus kami lakukan apabila kami melihat ada peserta yang curang atau\r\n\r\n### melanggar aturan MABAR?\r\n\r\n\r\n> MABAR menjunjung tinggi sportivitas dan kejujuran. Tim atau pemain yang\r\ncurang akan mendapatkan sanksi mulai dari teguran hingga dikeluarkan dari\r\nplatform sampai jangka waktu tidak terbatas. Peserta dapat melaporkan dugaan\r\nkecurangan kepada MABAR melalui hi@mabar.com dengan menyertakan bukti-\r\nbukti yang kuat. Kami akan merespons selambat-lambatnya dalam 2x24 jam.\r\n\r\n> MABAR memiliki tim khusus yang bertugas meneliti dugaan kecurangan dan\r\nmemberikan sanksi yang sesuai.
